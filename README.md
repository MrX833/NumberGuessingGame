# NumberGuessingGame
My awesome .NET CLI app where you play a game of number guessing!

to run the app simply open the source code in either visual studio and run it by pressing F5 or ctrl+F5 or in visual studio code and open it in a terminal. then you can run the app by typing "dotnet run" in the terminal and enjoy playing the game!
